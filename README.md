# JSAMissionControl
Junior Space Agency Mission Control

JSA is currently run by Indigo out of her bedroom, and she has to add all of the content herself, manually (or get her parents to do it)
In true Lean Startup fashion, we've measured how much work this is for us, and are going to pivot by 
automating a bunch of stuff and pushing a lot of the work onto you chaps, the users :) Cheers!

Allows members to upload details of their vehicles and missions, and view those added by everyone else.

Happy launches!
